# September JS
 - Started as just a JS port of my original commandline simulater in CPP
 - Improved it to support many more enigma machines, as well as being extendable to a custom engima design (e.g. modifying wirings in wheels, whether or not there is a greek wheel or  switchboard, whether or not the UKW can be set to different positions and ring settings etc.). Look at machines.json for examples.
- Supports 
    - Enigma I
    - Enigma M1 / M2 / M3 (all functionally equivalent)
    - Engima M4
    - Engima D / K (functionally equivalent)
    - Swiss-K Enigma (Air force wirings as these are the only ones recovered)
    - Norway Enigma 
    - Sondermaschine (Special machine)


   
# TODO
1. Improve UI
2. Add a graphic showing the step-by-step conversion
